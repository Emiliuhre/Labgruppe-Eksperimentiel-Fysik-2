\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\section{Setup}
%

For the experiment we use a 650 nm diode laser\autocite{pasco_os8525a_manual}, so the wavelength is somewhat constant. 
This laser is first sent through an aperture to decrease the intensity of the light, by \mbox{obstructing} some, because our sensor becomes saturated even at the lowest laser intensity.
Afterwards the beam is passed through a polarizer, set to 45 degrees, so the light is equally polarized in the $p$- and $s$-direction.
Then the light passes through a semicircular piece of glass, either hitting the curved side, or the flat side first, but in both cases the light is aimed to pass through the center of the circle.

The semicircular piece of glass is placed on a turntable, in order to have a variable $\theta_i$. 
Hitting the center of the would-be circle ensures that the beam is normal to the curved side despite rotation of the semi-circle.
%
To measure the transmitted and reflected light we have a light sensor\autocite{pasco_ci6604_manual}, that is also mounted on a turn table, so it can be turned to catch the light at different angles.
Both turntables have marked angles in degrees to accurately measure the different angles. 
%
Before the light enters the sensor it first goes through a collimating lens, to catch the light that spreads out and focus it on the sensor. 
Finally it goes through another polarizor, set such that only $p$- or $s$-polarized light respectively goes through.
%
\section{Measurements}
Measurements of the laser intensity are taken by a photodiode detector plugged into a PicoScope\autocite{PicoScope3203D}. 
The PicoScope measures the voltage over 1 second at $10^{5}$ sampels per second and calculates the mean voltage measured, together with a standard deviation.  
The measured voltage in the photodiode detector is proportional to the laser intensity. 
The angles are measured manually by reading on the angle scale. We measure 3 angles, $\theta_i$, $\theta_d = \theta_t \pm \theta_i$ (see figure \ref{fig:Thetad}), and $\theta_R = 180^\circ - \theta_r - \theta_1$, where $\theta_r$ is the reflection angle (we expect $\theta_i = \theta_r$).

% Spørg William hvad der sker med $\theta_R = 180^\circ - \theta_r - \theta_1$, er det rigtigt?

\section{Execution}
First the intensity of the laser is measured without the glass, for both $s$- and $p$-polarisation, as well as the background intensity.
Then the glass is placed, such that the laser \mbox{travels} through its center, and we measure the two mean intensities, standard errors and 3 angles. 
We then wary the angle of incidence, starting at 0 degrees, and moving in 5 degree increments up to 80 degrees. 
For each angle, we measure both the refracted and reflected beam, for both $s$- and $p$-polarized light.
We repeat this experiment twice, one where the light first hits the curved side, and one where it first hits the flat side.
