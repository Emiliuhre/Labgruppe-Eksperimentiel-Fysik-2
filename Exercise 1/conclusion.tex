\chapter{Conclusion}
In this rapport, we sought to determine the index of refraction of a medium, and investigate the validity of the Fresnel Equations.
This was done by measuring the angles of incidence, refraction, and reflection, as well as their respective intensities, for laser light moving through a semicircular dielectric.
In spite of numerous mistakes in the experiment, that made an accurate measurement of the index of refraction impossible,
the data still strongly supports the validity of the Fresnel equations.
