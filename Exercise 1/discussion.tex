When would it be useful to understand the Fresnel relations? \newline
A real-world use would be using polarized sunglasses, when going fishing. 
With normal sunglass filters like neutral density filters of different types, you let both $s$- and $p$-polarized glare form the surface of the water pass to your eye.

A better option is to take advantage of the Fresnel relations to filter out the glare at angles $\le$ Brewster's angle \cite{wiki:brewsters_angle}.
For an air-to-water interface, Brewster's angle is $\approx 56^\circ$ and vertically polarized sunglasses can block out most of the glare dependent on the angle of the sun.
With most of the $s$-polarized reflected light blocked from you eye, you can see below the surface of the water.
